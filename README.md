4. **Decision Making**:
   - **Network detection** determines available options
   - **Online**: Upload decision directly to GitHub
   - **Offline**: Export evidence file for later synchronization

### **🌐 Smart Network Modes**

**Research Buddy 3.0 adapts to your environment:**

```
🌐 Online Mode (Network Connected):
   📝 Upload Decision → Direct GitHub integration
   📊 Real-time training data collection
   � Immediate synchronization with institutional systems

📱 Offline Mode (No Network):
   📂 Export Evidence → Local file creation
   💾 Structured evidence preservation
   🔄 Sync later when network available
```

### **Enhanced Professional Workflow**
- **Text selection from PDFs** enables direct evidence capture
- **Two-tab interface** streamlines decision-making process
