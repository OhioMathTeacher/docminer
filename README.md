## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **The AI-Assisted Workflow (2-3 minutes per paper)**

1. **Load Paper** → **Run AI Analysis** → **Review Results** → **Accept/Reject** → **Save**

2. **AI Pre-Screening** analyzes each paper for:
   - Explicit positionality statements ("I acknowledge my position as...")
   - Subtle reflexivity markers ("This research emerged from my experience...")
   - Methodological awareness ("Our approach is shaped by...")
   - Identity positioning and bias acknowledgment

3. **Human Expert Review** validates AI findings and handles edge cases

### **Performance Comparison**
| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Scalability |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Manual Only** | 6-8 papers/hour | Variable | Limited |
| **Research Buddy 2.0** | 15-25 papers/hour | 80%+ with oversight | 1000+ papers/week |
