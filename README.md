2. **AI Pre-Screening** analyzes each paper for:
   - Explicit positionality statements ("I acknowledge my position as...")
   - Subtle reflexivity markers ("This research emerged from my experience...")
   - Methodological awareness ("Our approach is shaped by...")
   - Identity positioning and bias acknowledgment

3. **Human Expert Review** validates AI findings and handles edge cases

### **🏭 Institutional Automation Scale**

```
📊 1,000 Papers per Week Analysis:
   🤖 Auto-Accept: 150 papers (15%) - Clear positionality
   ❌ Auto-Reject: 600 papers (60%) - No positionality  
   📋 Human Review: 250 papers (25%) - Uncertain cases
   
⚡ Results: 75% Full Automation Rate
⏰ Time Savings: 88.8% reduction in manual work
💰 Cost Savings: $150K+ annually for typical institution
```

### **Revolutionary Research Capabilities**
