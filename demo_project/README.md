# Demo Project: Positionality Analysis Training

This is a sample project to demonstrate Research Buddy's capabilities for graduate assistants.

## What's Included

- **Sample PDFs**: Academic papers with clear positionality statements
- **Example Analysis**: Completed analysis showing what to look for
- **Training Guide**: Step-by-step walkthrough for GAs

## How to Use This Demo

1. **Launch Research Buddy**: `python3 run_research_buddy.py`
2. **Select this folder**: Point Research Buddy to `/demo_project/sample_papers/`
3. **Follow the guide**: Use `TRAINING_WALKTHROUGH.md` to practice
4. **Compare results**: Check your analysis against the examples

## Learning Objectives

- Identify positionality statements in academic writing
- Practice text selection and evidence gathering
- Understand the difference between researcher positioning and methodology
- Learn to use AI assistance vs. manual analysis
