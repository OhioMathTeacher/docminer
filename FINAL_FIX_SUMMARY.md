# FINAL FIX - GitHub Actions Release Issues

## Root Cause Identified

The error "Resource not accessible by integration" when fetching GitHub release for `refs/heads/main` occurred because:

1. **The action was looking for a release on a BRANCH** (`refs/heads/main`) instead of a TAG
2. **Permission issue** - The GITHUB_TOKEN didn't have explicit permissions to work with git tags
3. **Missing checkout** - The release job couldn't access git to verify/create tags

## Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Added Required Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write    # For creating releases and pushing tags
  actions: read      # For downloading artifacts
  packages: read     # For package operations
```

### 2. Added Checkout Step for Git Access
```yaml
- name: Checkout code (for tagging)
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Get full history for tagging
```

### 3. Ensure Tag Exists Before Release
```yaml
- name: Create or verify tag
  run: |
    git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
    git config user.email "actions@github.com"
    
    if git rev-parse v5.1.1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "✅ Tag v5.1.1 already exists"
    else
      echo "📝 Creating tag v5.1.1"
      git tag -a v5.1.1 -m "Release v5.1.1"
      git push origin v5.1.1
    fi
```

### 4. Upgraded Release Action
```yaml
uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2  # v2 has better error handling
with:
  generate_release_notes: false
  make_latest: true
```

## What This Fixes

✅ **Tag Creation** - Ensures v5.1.1 tag exists before creating release  
✅ **Permission Issues** - Explicit permissions for all needed operations  
✅ **Branch vs Tag** - Works with tags, not branches  
✅ **Artifact Upload** - Flattened structure ensures files are found  
✅ **Universal Binary** - macOS builds for both Intel and Apple Silicon  

## Complete Workflow Flow

1. **Build Job** (per platform)
   - Install dependencies
   - Build executable
   - Create DMG/AppImage/ZIP
   - Upload to artifacts/

2. **Create-Release Job**
   - Download all artifacts
   - Flatten directory structure
   - **Checkout code** (NEW)
   - **Create/verify tag** (NEW)
   - Create GitHub release
   - Upload all files

## Test This

1. Go to: https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy/actions
2. Click "Manual Build All Platforms"
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
4. Watch for:
   - ✅ All 3 platforms build
   - ✅ Tag creation/verification succeeds
   - ✅ Release created with all 4 files

## Expected Results

After successful run:
- **macOS**: `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1.dmg` (Universal Binary - Intel + Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-windows.zip`
- **Linux**: `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-linux.tar.gz` + `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-x86_64.AppImage`
