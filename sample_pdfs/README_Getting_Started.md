## Welcome to the Enhanced PDF Training System!

This folder contains sample PDFs for training the positionality detection system. Here's how to get started:

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Add Your PDFs**: Copy your academic papers (PDF files) into this `sample_pdfs` folder
2. **Launch Training**: The interface will automatically load PDFs from this folder
3. **Start Training**: Use the text selection tools to highlight positionality statements
4. **Label & Export**: Mark examples as positive/negative and export training data

### 📁 Folder Structure
- `sample_pdfs/` - Place your PDF files here for training
- The system will automatically detect and load all PDFs from this folder
- You can organize into subfolders if needed

### 🎯 Training Workflow
1. **Select Text**: Click and drag to select text from PDFs (now with line-based selection!)
2. **Make Judgment**: Choose "Yes - Explicit positionality" or "No positionality statements"
3. **Add Evidence**: Selected text automatically populates the evidence field
4. **Choose Patterns**: Select which patterns apply to the selected text

- **Text Extraction**: Instant text copying for evidence collection
- **AI Detection**: See what the current system detects in each paper

### 📝 Tips for Effective Training
- Look for statements where authors reveal their identity, background, or perspective
- Include context around positionality statements for better training
- Mark clear positive and negative examples to improve AI accuracy
- Use the pattern checkboxes to categorize different types of positionality language

### 🆘 Getting Help
- Check the console output for debugging information
- Use "Copy to Evidence" button to move selected text to training fields
- Resize window as needed - selection will auto-clear to prevent coordinate issues
