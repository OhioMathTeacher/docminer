## DALL-E GENERATION TIPS

### Settings to Use:
- **Style:** Natural (for realistic mockups) or Vivid (for character avatars)
- **Quality:** Standard (faster) or HD (higher quality)
- **Size:** 1024x1024 (square) or 1792x1024 (landscape for title cards)

### Regeneration Tips:
- If text looks garbled, ask DALL-E to "improve text clarity"
- If characters don't match, specify exact details: "gray beard, glasses, age 50s"
- For UI mockups, emphasize "clean, modern, professional interface design"

### Editing After Generation:
- Use any image editor to add **actual text labels** if DALL-E text is unclear
- Crop to 16:9 aspect ratio if needed for video
- Add transparency/PNG if you want to overlay on video

---

## ALTERNATIVE: Use Canva for Simple Graphics

For simpler images like the decision matrix or flowcharts, you can also use **Canva.com** (free):
1. Search templates for "flowchart" or "decision tree"
2. Customize with your text
3. Export as PNG
4. Often cleaner text than DALL-E for diagrams

---

## FILE ORGANIZATION

Save all generated images to:
```
docs/video_tutorial/images/
```

Naming convention:
- `01_professor_todd.png`
- `02_research_buddy.png`
- `03_maya.png`
- `04_title_card.png`
- etc.

This keeps them in scene order for easy import to video editor!

## ESTIMATED COSTS

**Using ChatGPT Plus ($20/month):**
- Unlimited DALL-E 3 generations included
- Generate all 20+ images at no extra cost

**Using OpenAI API directly:**
- DALL-E 3 Standard: $0.040 per image
- 20 images = $0.80 total
- HD quality: $0.080 per image = $1.60 total

**Very affordable either way!** 💰
