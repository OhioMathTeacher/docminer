# PDF Viewer UX Improvements - v6.1.1
## October 13, 2025

---

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

Based on feedback from Becca (GA testing session), the following usability issues were identified and fixed:

### Issue 1: PDF Viewer Space Constraints
**Problem:** The PDF viewing area was too small, especially for users with smaller screens. The "Selected Text for Evidence" panel at the bottom took up valuable vertical space, and the PDF couldn't scroll to show the full document.

**Solution:**
- Made the "Selected Text" panel **collapsible** (checkbox-style GroupBox)
- Starts **collapsed by default** to maximize PDF viewing space
- When expanded, limited to 120px height instead of 180px
- Added helpful tooltip explaining the workflow

### Issue 2: Limited Zoom Range
**Problem:** Zoom only went up to 100%, which was too small on smaller displays. Users couldn't enlarge text for better readability.

**Solution:**
- Extended zoom range from 50% up to **200%**
- Changed zoom options to: "Auto", "50%", "65%", "80%", "100%", "125%", "150%", "175%", "200%"
- Default is "Auto" which intelligently fits based on view mode

### Issue 3: View Mode Optimization
**Problem:** No easy way to optimize PDF display for standard paper sizes (Letter, A4) or fill the entire viewing area.

**Solution:**
- Added new **"View" dropdown** with options:
  - **Letter** (8.5×11) - Optimizes for US Letter paper portrait orientation
  - **A4** (210×297mm) - Optimizes for A4 paper portrait orientation
  - **Full Width** - Fills available width, allows vertical scrolling
  - **Full Height** - Fills available height, allows horizontal scrolling if needed
  - **Custom** - Uses actual PDF dimensions
- View mode works in combination with zoom percentage

### Issue 4: Width Constraints
**Problem:** PDF panel had a 500px maximum width limit that prevented it from using available screen space.

**Solution:**
- Removed `setMaximumWidth(500)` constraint
- Changed to `setSizePolicy(QSizePolicy.Expanding, QSizePolicy.Expanding)`
- PDF panel now uses all available horizontal space

## 📚 Documentation Improvements

### Issue 5: Unclear AI Behavior
**Problem:** Users (Becca) were confused about:
1. Does AI analyze the full document or just "Human Input"?
2. What should go in "Human Input"?
3. Where to find training data?

**Solution:**

#### Added Info Labels to Input Tabs

**Human Input Tab:**
```
📝 Manual Evidence Collection - Enter quotes/citations you manually identified:
```
With tooltip:
```
This field is for YOUR manual evidence collection.

The AI analyzes the ENTIRE document automatically, not just what you put here.
Use this field to record specific quotes, page numbers, or notes that you want to highlight.
```

**AI Input Tab:**
```
🤖 AI Automatic Analysis - The AI reads and analyzes the ENTIRE document:
```
With tooltip:
```
The AI automatically processes the complete document text.

This analysis is independent of what you enter in 'Human Input'.
The AI scans the full paper to identify positionality statements, patterns, and context.
```

#### Added Quick Help Menu Item

New menu: **Help → Quick Help** (💡)

Provides answers to:
- What does the AI analyze? (Full document)
- What should I put in "Human Input"? (Manual findings)
- Where can I find training data? (Shows current folder)
- My PDF doesn't fit properly (View mode + Zoom instructions)
- How do I collect evidence? (Step-by-step workflow)

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `enhanced_training_interface.py`

### Code Changes Summary

#### 1. Collapsible Selected Text Panel (Lines ~1476-1508)
```python
text_extract_group = QGroupBox("Selected Text")
text_extract_group.setCheckable(True)
text_extract_group.setChecked(False)  # Start collapsed
# ... reduced height from 180px to 120px max
```

#### 2. View Mode + Extended Zoom Controls (Lines ~500-530)
```python
# View mode dropdown
self.view_mode_combo = QComboBox()
self.view_mode_combo.addItems([
    "Letter", "A4", "Full Width", "Full Height", "Custom"
])

# Extended zoom range
self.zoom_combo.addItems([
    "Auto", "50%", "65%", "80%", "100%", "125%", "150%", "175%", "200%"
])
```

#### 3. Smart Zoom Calculation (Lines ~565-610)
```python
def calculate_zoom_scale(self, zoom_text):
    """Calculate scale factor based on view mode and zoom selection"""
    # Determines base scale from view mode (Letter/A4/etc.)
    # Then applies zoom multiplier (50%-200%)
    # Returns combined scale factor
```

#### 4. PDF Panel Width Expansion (Lines ~1510-1520)
```python
# Allow PDF panel to expand naturally - no width limits
pdf_panel.setMinimumWidth(600)  # Readable minimum
pdf_panel.setSizePolicy(QSizePolicy.Expanding, QSizePolicy.Expanding)
```

#### 5. Info Labels on Input Tabs (Lines ~1638-1680)
```python
# Human Input tab info label
human_info = QLabel("📝 Manual Evidence Collection...")
human_info.setToolTip("This field is for YOUR manual evidence collection...")

# AI Input tab info label  
ai_info = QLabel("🤖 AI Automatic Analysis...")
ai_info.setToolTip("The AI automatically processes the complete document text...")
```

#### 6. Quick Help Dialog (Lines ~1418-1455)
```python
def show_quick_help(self):
    """Show quick help dialog answering common questions"""
    # Displays FAQ-style help with HTML formatting
    # Includes current folder location
```
