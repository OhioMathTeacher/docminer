## Scene 2: Configuration Dialog (2 minutes)

### File: `scene2_maya_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
Oh! A configuration window popped up the first time I launched the app. What do I need to enter here?
```

### File: `scene2_professor_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Great question, Maya! Let's go through each field. First, you'll need an OpenAI API key.
```

### File: `scene2_buddy_01.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
The API key lets me access ChatGPT to help analyze text and identify positionality patterns. You can get one from platform.openai.com.
```

### File: `scene2_professor_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Next is the GitHub token. This is how we'll save and share your analysis work with the team.
```

### File: `scene2_maya_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
So the API key is for the AI analysis, and the GitHub token is for uploading our work. Got it!
```

### File: `scene2_buddy_02.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
Exactly! Now, let's talk about the GitHub username and repository fields.
```

### File: `scene2_professor_03.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Enter 'OhioMathTeacher' as the username - that's my GitHub account. And 'docminer' as the repository name.
```

### File: `scene2_maya_03.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
So all graduate assistants will upload to the same repository? That makes it easy for you to collect our work!
```

### File: `scene2_buddy_03.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
Precisely! All training data goes to one central location. Now click 'Save Configuration' and we're ready to analyze some papers!
```

## Scene 3: Loading PDFs and Entering Name (1 minute)

### File: `scene3_maya_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
Okay, the app is loaded. I see a field asking for my name. I'll enter 'Maya' - this becomes part of my filenames, right?
```

### File: `scene3_professor_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Exactly! Your name helps us track which graduate assistant reviewed which papers. Now click 'Select Folder' to load some PDFs.
```

### File: `scene3_buddy_01.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
I see you've selected a folder with academic papers. Great! I'll load them in the order they appear. You can navigate through them using 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons.
```

### File: `scene3_maya_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
Perfect! The first PDF is now displayed. I can see the full text, and there's a page navigation at the bottom.
```

## Scene 4: Selecting Text for Evidence (2 minutes)

### File: `scene4_professor_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Now comes the most important part, Maya. When you find a positionality statement, you need to highlight it as evidence.
```

### File: `scene4_maya_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
I found something! This author says 'As a White researcher working in communities of color, I acknowledge my privilege.' How do I capture that?
```

### File: `scene4_buddy_01.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
Great find! Simply click and drag to select the text. I'll copy it to the 'Selected Text for Evidence' panel on the right.
```

### File: `scene4_maya_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
Oh, I see it! The text appeared in the evidence panel. I can edit it if I selected too much or too little.
```

### File: `scene4_professor_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Exactly. You can select multiple passages throughout the paper. They'll all be saved together as your human-identified evidence.
```

## Scene 5: AI-Assisted Analysis (2 minutes)

### File: `scene5_maya_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
I notice there's a button called 'Run Initial Analysis with AI'. Should I use that?
```

### File: `scene5_buddy_01.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
Absolutely! I can pre-scan the entire document and suggest passages that might contain positionality statements. It's a huge time-saver!
```

### File: `scene5_professor_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Think of it as a first pass. The AI highlights likely candidates, but YOU make the final decision. That's why we call it AI-assisted, not AI-decided.
```

### File: `scene5_maya_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
Okay, I clicked it. Wow! It found three potential passages and displayed them with confidence scores and pattern types.
```

### File: `scene5_buddy_02.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
I found patterns like 'first-person reflexivity' and 'identity disclosure'. These are common markers of positionality statements.
```

### File: `scene5_professor_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Now review what the AI found. You can accept it, modify it, or reject it completely. Your expert judgment is what makes this training data valuable.
```

## Scene 6: Making Judgments and Decisions (2 minutes)

### File: `scene6_maya_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
I've reviewed both my selected text and the AI suggestions. This paper definitely has explicit positionality statements. What do I click?
```

### File: `scene6_professor_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
You have four judgment options: Positive Explicit, Positive Implicit, Negative, or Uncertain. This paper sounds like Positive Explicit.
```

### File: `scene6_buddy_01.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
Positive Explicit means the author clearly and directly states their positionality. Implicit would be more subtle references. Negative means no positionality statement found.
```

### File: `scene6_maya_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
Got it! I'll select Positive Explicit and add a confidence rating of 5 out of 5 - I'm very certain about this one.
```

### File: `scene6_professor_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Perfect! You can also add notes in the 'Pattern Suggestions' field if you notice specific markers or themes worth highlighting.
```

### File: `scene6_maya_03.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
I'll note 'Clear acknowledgment of racial identity and privilege in research context.' Now I'll click 'Save and Next' to move to the next paper.
```

## Scene 7: Uploading and Wrap-Up (1 minute)

### File: `scene7_buddy_01.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
Great work, Maya! You've analyzed five papers. Now let's upload your decisions to the GitHub repository.
```

### File: `scene7_maya_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
I see an 'Upload Decision' button. When I click it, what happens?
```

### File: `scene7_professor_01.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
Your analysis gets converted to both JSON and Markdown formats, then uploaded to the docminer repository under the training_reports folder.
```

### File: `scene7_buddy_02.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner  
**Text to paste:**
```
The filename includes your name, the paper title, your judgment, and a timestamp. For example: Maya_Armstrong_positive_20251010.json
```

### File: `scene7_maya_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Maya  
**Text to paste:**
```
Perfect! I see a success message. My work is saved and shared with the team. This is so much easier than manual spreadsheets!
```

### File: `scene7_professor_02.mp3`
**Voice:** Professor Todd  
**Text to paste:**
```
That's the power of DocMiner - combining AI efficiency with human expertise. Thanks for joining us today!
```

### File: `scene7_buddy_03.mp3`
**Voice:** DocMiner
