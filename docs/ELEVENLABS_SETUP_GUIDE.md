### Step 4: Organize Your Files

```
research-buddy/
  docs/
    video_tutorial/
      audio/
        scene1_professor_intro.mp3
        scene1_buddy_intro.mp3
        scene1_maya_intro.mp3
        scene2_professor_config.mp3
        scene2_buddy_apikey.mp3
        scene2_maya_question.mp3
        ... etc

        VIDEO_TUTORIAL_SCRIPT.md
        recording_notes.txt
```

## Character Line Count (for planning)

**Total script:** ~3,500 words = ~28,000 characters

**Breakdown by character:**
- Professor Todd: ~1,200 words (~9,600 characters)
- Research Buddy: ~1,100 words (~8,800 characters)
- Maya: ~1,200 words (~9,600 characters)

**Free tier limit:** 10,000 characters/month

**Solution:** You'll need to either:
1. Upgrade to paid tier ($5/month for 30,000 chars) **RECOMMENDED**
2. Split across 3 months (generate one character per month)
3. Use multiple free accounts

**Pro tip:** The $5/month "Starter" plan is worth it for video production!

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Add pauses** with commas and periods in the script
2. **Use SSML tags** for emphasis (if needed):
   - `<break time="0.5s"/>` for pauses
   - `<emphasis level="strong">important word</emphasis>` for stress
   
3. **Generate in sections** - Don't try to do whole scenes at once
   - Easier to edit
   - Can re-generate individual lines if needed

4. **Listen before downloading** - ElevenLabs lets you preview
   - Adjust settings if voice doesn't sound right
   - Regenerate until it's perfect

## Alternative: Voice Cloning (Advanced)

If you want truly custom voices:
1. Record 1-2 minutes of your own voice reading the script
2. Upload to ElevenLabs Professional Voice Cloning
3. Generate all dialogue in your cloned voice
4. Pitch-shift in post-production for different characters

## Next Steps After Audio Generation

1. **Import audio into video editor** (DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, iMovie)
2. **Sync with screen recording** of Research Buddy
3. **Add character images** as overlays in corner
4. **Add visual callouts** (arrows, circles, text highlights)
5. **Export final video**

## Cost Estimate

**Recommended Setup:**
- ElevenLabs Starter: $5/month (cancel after first month)
- Total characters needed: ~28,000
- Starter plan: 30,000 characters ‚úì
