Training Buddy (Graduate Assistant Interface)\nThe interactive front end for researchers and graduate assistants.\nProvides AI-assisted paper-by-paper analysis (10\u201320 papers/hour).\nFeatures: scrollable previews, live highlighting, one-click acceptance/rejection, and smart\ndropdowns.",
    "ai_analysis": "AI Analysis for about.pdf\n\nConfidence Level: Low (0.200)\nRecommendation: Minimal indicators found\nPatterns Detected: None\n\n\nEvidence Excerpts Found: #1 - Ai Explanation\nLikely Location: Introduction/Background\n\u274c MINIMAL or NO positionality detected (Confidence: 0.20) No clear positionality statements were identified in this paper. The author does not explicitly discuss their position, background, or potential biases.\n\n\n#2 - Final Assessment\nLikely Location: Methodology\nThe preliminary findings indicate a lack of identifiable patterns, which raises concerns about the robustness of the data collection and analysis processes. The absence of patterns suggests that either the data collected is insufficiently rich or that the analytical framework applied may not be adequately sensitive to the nuances of the data....\n\n\n\nAI Recommendation:\nWeak indicators found. Recommend manual review for thorough analysis.",
