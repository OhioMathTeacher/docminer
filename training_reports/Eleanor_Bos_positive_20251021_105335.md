What is it that engages us in the\nsubject? What are we trying to find, or to learn through our research?\nHow do we teach it, what lessons do we attempt to pass on to our\nstudents? And how as researchers, teachers, and students do our dif\nferent positionalities as Americans, Germans, non-Jews, and Jews (with\nor without a familial connection to the Holocaust) come into play in our\nengagement with the subject? I believe that these questions are important\nto investigate, for whereas our emotional investment in this work seems\nundeniable, the nature of this investment, and the kinds of work to\nwhich it leads us, have often been left unexamined.\n\n[Page 5]\nMy concern about these issues stems in part from my own peculiar\nexperience with the role identity politics plays in my work on the\nHolocaust. As a female, relatively young scholar with a foreign first and\nlast name that are not recognizable as Jewish, and as a person who does\nnot \"look Jewish\" (certainly not in a North American context where this\nmeans something a bit different from Western Europe), I have often\nbeen looked upon as an outsider in public academic forums such as\nHolocaust conferences. Apparently not personally connected to this\nhistory as a survivor or a child of a survivor, nor as a Jew, nor as a\ncontemporary, I find that I often feel as if I have to legitimize my work\nor my involvement in this field. (Why do I do this work? Why does so\nmuch of my research and teaching deal with the Holocaust? What are\nthe lessons I draw from this history?) Sometimes I refuse to do so, while\nat other times I make use of the powerful status of the \"authentic\" in\nthis field by revealing publicly who I \"really\" am, namely, not only a\n(Dutch) Jew, but also the daughter of a Holocaust survivor.\n\n[Page 5]\nThis revelation, this \"autobiographical posturing,\" comes about in\none of two ways, either before my conference presentations in the form\nof a brief line in my biography, which the moderator of my panel will\nread out loud (\"born and raised in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, she is\nthe daughter of a Dutch-Jewish Holocaust survivor\"), or I may disclose\nthis information myself during the discussion afterwards. In either case,\nthe revelation is both powerful and embarrassing. Powerful, for by do\ning so, I, personally, and therefore the work I do, seem to gain in\nlegitimacy. No longer a complete outsider as I seemed to be before, my\nopinion now counts, as my perceived proximity to the Holocaust experi\nence, my \"authenticity,\" my personal, familial, connection are seen as\nan advantage, as a genuine source of knowledge, and as a position from\nor investment may differ from that of scholars without a familial\nconnection, how this background might actually play a role in my case,\nand in general (and inform our work and teaching, for good or for bad),\nis never questioned. Playing along with this authenticity game, then, is\nembarrassing, for, on some level, by entertaining it, I seem to suggest\nthat there is some validity to it, and in turn, I forgo an opportunity to\nquestion publicly how precisely positionality, mine or anyone else's,\nmight indeed affect this work.\n\n[Page 13]\nWhile I have found the notion of (familial) postmemory very useful\nfor me personally, because it allowed me to conceptualize my own pro\nfoundly complex relationship as a child of a survivor to this past,15 my\nconcern is that when postmemory is used in a broader cultural sense as\n\"retrospective witnessing by adoption,\" the potentially problematic pro\ncesses of \"identification, adoption and projection\" that are involved may\nnot be sufficiently analyzed.\n\n[Page 16]\nMy problem with the book is that it seems packaged to do precisely\nthat. The book's layout is beautiful, many of the men, women, and\nchildren in the photos are attractive, and the images are presented with\nout much context. All of this invites fetishization. It is a pleasure to look\n\n[Page 17]\nthe sheer size of the project and the anonymity of\nmost photos make me feel as if I am intruding into lives that were never\nmeant to be this public, lives that are made into a spectacle without\npermission.\n\n[Page 17]\nPerhaps because of my own personal connection with this history,\ngrowing up with identical snapshots of (my own) murdered relatives in\nwhich we as a family had a tremendous emotional investment, I tend to\nresist this transformation from the personal attachment to the collective\nsign. Despite the kind of profound postmemory these photographs may\nelicit through our ability to identify with them, we should not lose sight\nthe fact that the people in these photos are indeed not our family, are\nus, and furthermore, that they were indeed someone else's relatives.\nThese photos, taken along to Auschwitz by relatives or friends precisely\nbecause they felt an emotional attachment to the people depicted\nthem, are now displayed as iconic \"traces,\" representing no longer the\npeople in the photographs or their owners, those who loved them, but\nmore symbolically, the losses of the Holocaust, the loss of innocence, of\nnormal lives, of entire communities. I take issue with this kind of sym\nbolic presentation and the \"idiopathic, narcissistic\" looking it invites\n(Hirsch, \"Projected Memory\" 10), and I am asking others to resist it,\ntoo.\n\n[Page 20]\nMy hope is that a call to a return of a more open discussion of these\nissues of personal investment and positionality, as established within\nfeminist theory, will lead to scholarship in which positionality can\nindeed be acknowledged and investigated in more complex ways, not\njust in working on the subject of the Holocaust, but in the field of\nGerman Studies more generally. Furthermore, such an investigation",
