    "evidence": "This study examined Oregon\u2019s early intervention (EI) and early childhood special education (ECSE) pipelines as a function\nof children\u2019s intersecting ethnicity and home language(s) with a focus on children from Latino/a backgrounds with\ncommunication disorders. We found differences in children\u2019s referral source and age of referral, likelihood of evaluation\nand placement, and type of placement for conditions related to communication, including autism spectrum disorder and\nhearing impairment. Results showed differences in EI and ECSE; however, disproportionality appeared greatest among\nSpanish-speaking Latino/a children and non-Latino/a children who spoke languages other than English compared to\nnon-Latino/a English-speaking counterparts. Our findings suggest that attending to children\u2019s intersecting ethnicity and\nlanguage backgrounds in referral, evaluation, and placement add nuance to examinations of disproportionality.
