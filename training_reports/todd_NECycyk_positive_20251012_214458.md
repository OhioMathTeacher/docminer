## Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Pattern Discovery**: Analyze evidence quotes for new regex patterns
2. **False Negative Review**: Check papers marked negative for missed statements  
3. **Validation Testing**: Test discovered patterns on validation set
4. **System Integration**: Add successful patterns to detection engine

We found differences in children\u2019s referral source and age of referral, likelihood of evaluation\nand placement, and type of placement for conditions related to communication, including autism spectrum disorder and\nhearing impairment. Results showed differences in EI and ECSE; however, disproportionality appeared greatest among\nSpanish-speaking Latino/a children and non-Latino/a children who spoke languages other than English compared to\nnon-Latino/a English-speaking counterparts. Our findings suggest that attending to children\u2019s intersecting ethnicity and\nlanguage backgrounds in referral, evaluation, and placement add nuance to examinations of disproportionality.
