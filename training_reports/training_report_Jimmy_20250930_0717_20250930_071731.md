## Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Pattern Discovery**: Analyze evidence quotes for new regex patterns
2. **False Negative Review**: Check papers marked negative for missed statements  
3. **Validation Testing**: Test discovered patterns on validation set
4. **System Integration**: Add successful patterns to detection engine
