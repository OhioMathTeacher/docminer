No pattern suggestions provided.

## Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Pattern Discovery**: Analyze evidence quotes for new regex patterns
2. **False Negative Review**: Check papers marked negative for missed statements  
3. **Validation Testing**: Test discovered patterns on validation set

The author does not explicitly discuss their position, background, or potential biases.\n\n\n#2 - Final Assessment\nLikely Location: Results/Findings\nThe preliminary findings indicate a lack of discernible patterns in the data collected, which raises concerns about the robustness of the analysis. The absence of patterns suggests that either the data may not be rich enough, or the analytical framework applied may not be adequately capturing the nuances of the qualitative data....\n\n\n\nAI Recommendation:\nWeak indicators found. Recommend manual review for thorough analysis.",
