## Evidence Examples


### Example 1: about.pdf
- **Confidence**: 3/5
- **Patterns**: None specified
- **Evidence**: "Iâ€™ve been created to help you with your PDF analysis needs. Version 1.0 has been trained to look for positionality statements in
PDFs. I analyze content contextually to look for passages where authors..."

## Pattern Suggestions

No pattern suggestions provided.

## Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Pattern Discovery**: Analyze evidence quotes for new regex patterns
2. **False Negative Review**: Check papers marked negative for missed statements  
3. **Validation Testing**: Test discovered patterns on validation set
4. **System Integration**: Add successful patterns to detection engine

Results showed differences in EI and ECSE; however, disproportionality appeared greatest among\nSpanish-speaking Latino/a children and non-Latino/a children who spoke languages other than English compared to\nnon-Latino/a English-speaking counterparts. Our findings suggest that attending to children\u2019s intersecting ethnicity and\nlanguage backgrounds in referral, evaluation, and placement add nuance to examinations of disproportionality. Results also\nindicate that practices related to characterizing children\u2019s communication disorders likely make substantial contributions to\ninequities in EI and ECSE. Precise identification of differences in service provision can lead to targeted policy and practice\nsolutions to reduce structural barriers to care in EI/ECSE systems and improve equity, particularly as related to placement\nfor children of color with communication concerns.",
