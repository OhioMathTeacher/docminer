For instance, in 1984,\nthe journal Studies in Art Education identified the 1965 Penn State Seminar as the\nmajor antecedent to Discipline-Based Art Education (DBAE). During Fall 2015,\nthree decades afterward, a colloquium course at Penn State critically reflected\nupon the seminar, and the following year, in Spring 2016, Penn State hosted a\n3-day conference at Penn State to commemorate the 1965 landmark seminar.\nThroughout 1965 and during the years preceding the 1965 seminar, there\nwas much civil unrest in the United States, including Civil Rights protests.
