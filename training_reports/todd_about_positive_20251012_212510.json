This is your training interface for improving the positionality detection system.\nI\u2019ve been created to help you with your PDF analysis needs. Version 1.0 has been trained to look for positionality statements in\nPDFs. I analyze content contextually to look for passages where authors discuss their identity and its impact on their writing\nwithin their published work.\nQuick Start\nAdd PDFs: Copy your academic papers to the ExtractorPDFs folder\nSelect Text: Click and drag to highlight positionality statements\nMake Judgments: Mark as positive/negative examples\nAdd Evidence: Selected text automatically populates evidence fields",

The author does not explicitly discuss their position, background, or potential biases.\n\n\n#2 - Final Assessment\nLikely Location: Results/Findings\nThe preliminary findings indicate a lack of identified patterns, which suggests that the analysis may not have effectively captured the nuances of positionality within the texts reviewed. The absence of patterns could stem from either a limited dataset or insufficient engagement with the texts....\n\n\n\nAI Recommendation:\nWeak indicators found. Recommend manual review for thorough analysis.",
