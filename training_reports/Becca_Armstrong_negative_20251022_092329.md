No pattern suggestions provided.

## Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Pattern Discovery**: Analyze evidence quotes for new regex patterns
2. **False Negative Review**: Check papers marked negative for missed statements  
3. **Validation Testing**: Test discovered patterns on validation set
4. **System Integration**: Add successful patterns to detection engine

One (Yang Deng) is a cultural outsider, beyond\nborders of her home country, while the other (Wanda Knight) is a cultural\noutsider, within the bounds of her own country.

Knight is in her late fifties and of African descent. She grew up\nthe southern region of the United States during racially segregated times in the\n1950s and 1960s. She moved to the North in pursuit of higher education. She\ncrossed borders of race, class, and gender in the United States, and has not yet\nsense of belonging within the context of the academy.\n\n[Page 4]\nEven so, as women of color, we are outsiders within an academic context\ncontrolled by insider groups.
