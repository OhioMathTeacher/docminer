Subject: Research Buddy v5.0 - Ready to Download (No VS Code Required!)

Becca and Eleanor:

Thank you two for your enthusiasm! I think you'll find the VS Code work genuinely remarkable (Becca, wasn't it amazing getting a glimpse of the genAI writing code all by itself? Truly wild!)

Since we last spoke, I've made HUGE improvements to Research Buddy! We've gone from basic functionality to a polished, professional application. Here's what's new:

## **Research Buddy v5.0 is Live!**

**No more VS Code needed!** The app now has a complete user interface with:
- **One-click download** - Just download and double-click to run
- **Built-in configuration** - Enter your API keys directly in the app (no more terminal commands!)
- **Smart button feedback** - Color-coded buttons show you exactly what's set up and what needs attention
- **Secure password fields** - API keys are hidden when you type them
- **Works immediately** - You can start analyzing PDFs right away, even without API keys

## **How to Get It:**

1. **Visit the GitHub releases page:** https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy/releases/latest
2. **Download** `ResearchBuddy5.0.app.zip` (for macOS) 
3. **Extract** the zip file and double-click `ResearchBuddy5.0.app`
4. **That's it!** The app launches immediately

## **About API Keys:**

The good news is **API keys are now optional for getting started!** You can:
- **Start immediately** with manual analysis (works great!)
- **Add AI features later** by entering your OpenAI API key in the app's settings

When you're ready for AI features, I can still provide you with an API key when you stop by (you're right, it's like a credit card number and shouldn't be emailed).

## **New Features You'll Love:**

- **PDF viewer** with text selection
- **Export evidence** to files (works without any setup)
- **AI analysis** (when you add your API key)
- **Training mode** for learning positionality detection
- **Helpful error messages** that actually tell you what to do

The interface is now so intuitive that you can start analyzing papers immediately without any technical setup!
