# Next Session TODO - Release Upload Issue

## Current Status: Files Build Successfully But Won't Upload to Release ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- All 3 platform builds complete successfully (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Artifacts are created and stored in GitHub Actions
- Files are properly flattened to `release-files/` directory
- macOS now builds for ARM64 (works on Intel via Rosetta 2)

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working
**Release upload fails** - Files can't be found by `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`

**Error:**
```
Pattern 'release-files/ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-windows.zip' does not match any files.
Pattern 'release-files/ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-linux.tar.gz' does not match any files.
Pattern 'release-files/ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-macos.dmg' does not match any files.
```

**Confirmed files exist:**
From "Display and flatten artifacts" step:
```
‚úÖ Files ready for release:
total 769M
-rw-r--r-- 1 runner runner 282M Oct  8 15:19 ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-linux.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 runner runner 257M Oct  8 15:19 ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-macos.dmg
-rw-r--r-- 1 runner runner 230M Oct  8 15:19 ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-windows.zip
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be that **the release action runs in a different working directory** or the files aren't persisting between steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions to Try Next Session

### Option 1: Add Debug Step Before Release
Add this step right before "Create or Update Release":
```yaml
- name: Verify files before release
  run: |
    pwd
    ls -la
    ls -la release-files/ || echo "release-files directory not found"
    find . -name "*.zip" -o -name "*.dmg" -o -name "*.tar.gz"
```

### Option 2: Use Different Upload Method
Try using GitHub CLI instead:
```yaml
- name: Upload to release using GitHub CLI
  run: |
    gh release upload v5.1.1 release-files/* --clobber
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Option 3: Upload Artifacts Directly
Use `actions/upload-release-asset` for each file individually:
```yaml
- name: Upload Windows
  uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
  with:
    upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
    asset_path: ./release-files/ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-windows.zip
    asset_name: ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-windows.zip
    asset_content_type: application/zip
```

### Option 4: Simplify - Single Artifact Pattern
Try the simplest possible pattern:
```yaml
files: release-files/*
```

## üìä Build Configuration Summary

### Commits Made This Session
- `b454f05` - Changed to native ARM64 build (fixed universal2 issue)
- `aaccd15` - Fixed DMG filename pattern
- `82bf04f` - Added detailed debugging
- `125bf74` - Added success condition for release job
- `64dd0f8` - Tried multiline glob patterns
- `51a7f52` - Documented success (premature)
- `b870207` - Fixed README links (reverted)
- `1cdafe1` - Reverted README to old filename
- `900b0eb` - Tried explicit filenames

### Current Workflow State
- ‚úÖ Builds work on all platforms
- ‚úÖ Files are created in `release-files/`
- ‚ùå Release action can't find files
- Setting: `fail_on_unmatched_files: false` (prevents failure but no files upload)

### README Status
Currently points to: `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1.dmg` (old file from previous release)

Needs to point to:
- `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-windows.zip`
- `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-linux.tar.gz`
- `ResearchBuddy-5.1.1-macos.dmg`

## üéØ Next Session Action Plan

1. **Add debug step** to verify exact file paths before release
2. **Try GitHub CLI upload** method (most likely to work)
3. **If that works**, update README with correct download links
4. **Test downloads** to ensure files are accessible
5. **Document final solution** for future releases

## üìù Files to Review
- `.github/workflows/manual-build.yml` - Release upload configuration
- `README.md` - Download links (currently pointing to old files)
- `build_files/ResearchBuddy5.1.1.spec` - PyInstaller config (working correctly)

## üîó Quick Links
- Workflow: https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy/actions/workflows/manual-build.yml
- Release: https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy/releases/tag/v5.1.1
- Latest commit: 900b0eb

**Session ended:** October 8, 2025
**Status:** Builds work, release upload still needs fix
**Priority:** HIGH - GAs need working download links
