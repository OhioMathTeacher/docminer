# 🎉 Research Buddy 2.0 Distribution Summary

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### **GitHub Actions Automated Builds**
- **Triggered**: Release tag `v2.0.0` pushed to GitHub
- **Building**: Windows (x64 & x86), macOS Universal, Linux x64
- **Output**: Professional GitHub Release with downloadable executables
- **ETA**: 10-15 minutes for all platforms to complete

### **Cross-Platform Strategy**

#### **✅ What You CAN Do From Linux:**
1. **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions handles all platforms ✨
2. **Linux Executables**: Local builds work perfectly (`python3 build.py`)
3. **Windows via Wine**: Possible but complex (not recommended)
4. **Professional Distribution**: GitHub Releases for easy GA access

#### **❌ What Requires Your Mac:**
1. **Native macOS Testing**: Ensure GUI works properly on macOS
2. **Code Signing**: For trusted macOS distribution (optional)
3. **Local macOS Development**: If you prefer working locally

## 🚀 **Next Steps - Immediate (Today)**

### **1. Monitor GitHub Actions Build** (5-10 min)
```bash
# Check build status at:
https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy/actions
```

### **2. Download & Test Release** (10 min)
```bash
# Once builds complete, test downloads from:
https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy/releases/tag/v2.0.0
```

### **3. Share with Beta Testers** (Today)
- **Linux Users**: Ready now
- **Windows Users**: Ready via GitHub Release
- **macOS Users**: Ready via GitHub Release

## 🖥️ **Moving to Your Mac - When & Why**

### **Do This When:**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions builds complete** and you want to test locally
