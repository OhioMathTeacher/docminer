## 🚀 **The AI-Assisted Workflow (2-3 minutes per paper)**

### **Step 1: Load Your Paper**
1. Open Research Buddy 2.0 Training Interface
2. Enter your name in the **"GA Name"** field (top left)
3. Select paper from folder or use navigation arrows

### **Step 2: AI Pre-Screening (30 seconds)**
1. Click **"🚀 Run Initial Analysis"** (orange button)
2. Wait for AI to scan the paper (5-10 seconds)
3. Review the **scrollable analysis window** which shows:
   - **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low/None
   - **AI Recommendation**: Explicit/Subtle/Manual Review/No positionality
   - **Evidence Excerpts**: Actual quotes with location estimates
   - **Pattern Types**: What the AI detected

### **Step 3: Quick Decision Path**

#### **If AI Found Good Evidence** (80% of cases):
1. **Click "✅ Accept AI Findings"**
2. **Verify the auto-filled form**:
   - Radio button pre-selected based on AI confidence
   - Evidence quotes auto-populated
   - Location dropdown auto-selected
   - Confidence slider set appropriately
3. **Review and adjust** if needed
4. **Click "Save & Next"**

#### **If AI Uncertain** (20% of cases):
1. **Click "❌ Reject - Manual Review"**
2. **Read paper carefully** for reflexivity statements
3. **Fill form manually** as usual
4. **Use extracted text feature** for easy quote copying

## 🎯 **What to Look For: Positionality Indicators**

### **Explicit Positionality (Click ✅ if AI finds these)**
- **Direct self-positioning**: "I acknowledge my position as..."
- **Identity statements**: "As a [identity], I recognize..."
- **Bias acknowledgment**: "We acknowledge our biases..."
- **Methodological reflexivity**: "Our approach is shaped by..."

### **Subtle/Implicit Positionality (AI often catches these)**
- **Experiential grounding**: "This research emerged from my experience..."
- **Contextual positioning**: "From this perspective, we approach..."
- **Background influence**: "My fieldwork revealed my own assumptions..."

### **Not Positionality (AI helps filter these out)**
- General methodology descriptions
- Literature review positioning
- Theoretical framework citations (without personal connection)
- Standard research limitations

---

## 📍 **Location Guidelines**

The AI will auto-select locations, but verify these are accurate:

- **Introduction/Background**: Opening positionality statements
- **Methodology**: Researcher positioning in methods
- **Results/Findings**: Reflexive observations during analysis  
- **Discussion**: Implications of researcher position
- **Throughout Paper**: Multiple sections contain reflexivity
- **Multiple Sections**: 3+ different locations

---

## ⚠️ **Quality Control: When to Override AI**

### **Trust the AI When**:
- High confidence (0.7+) with clear evidence quotes
- Multiple patterns detected consistently
- Evidence matches your manual scan

### **Question the AI When**:
- Low confidence (0.3-) but you see clear reflexivity
- Evidence seems out of context
- Location estimates seem wrong

### **Always Manual Review When**:
- Borderline cases (uncertain judgment)
- Papers in languages/fields AI struggles with
- When training on edge cases

---

## 📊 **Your Performance Metrics**

Research Buddy 2.0 tracks your work to ensure quality:

- **Papers per session**: Aim for 15-25 papers/hour with AI assistance
- **Evidence collection rate**: Provide quotes for 70%+ of positive cases
- **Confidence levels**: Average 3.5+ shows good training
- **Inter-GA agreement**: Consistency with other GAs on same papers

---

## 🔄 **Weekly Workflow Integration**

### **Individual Sessions**:
1. Start with **"Run Initial Analysis"** on every paper
2. Use **"Export & Upload"** button when done (auto-uploads to GitHub)
3. Session reports include your performance metrics

### **Batch Processing**:
- AI pre-screening enables processing 100s of papers/week
- Weekly institutional reports track overall program quality
- Pattern discoveries improve the system continuously

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Efficiency**

### **Maximize AI Benefits**:
- Always run initial analysis first - even if paper seems obvious
- Trust high-confidence AI recommendations (95%+ accuracy)
- Use "Accept AI Findings" liberally for clear cases

### **Speed Techniques**:
- Learn the keyboard shortcuts (if implemented)
- Focus manual reading time on AI-uncertain cases
- Use text selection tool for quick quote extraction

### **Quality Maintenance**:
- Verify AI location estimates make sense
- Add pattern suggestions when you notice AI missed something
- Include context around quoted evidence

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **AI Analysis Fails**:
- Check PDF is readable (not scanned image)
- Try manual review mode
- Report technical issues to supervisor

### **Evidence Auto-Population Problems**:
- Check if evidence makes sense in context
- Edit auto-filled text if needed
- Add missing context manually

### **Location Detection Issues**:
- Verify dropdown selection matches actual paper location
- Change to "Multiple Sections" if spread throughout
- Use "Throughout Paper" for papers with pervasive reflexivity

---
