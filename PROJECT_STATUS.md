# Project Status - October 7, 2025

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Documentation & README
- [x] Fixed corrupted README title (was showing "# Rese##")
- [x] Moved download links to TOP of README (user's primary request!)
- [x] Created clear 3-option approach: Download executables ‚Üí Codespaces ‚Üí Developer mode
- [x] Added GA_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common git clone issues
- [x] Created EXECUTABLE_DOWNLOAD.md with platform-specific instructions
- [x] Created NEXT_STEPS_LINUX.md for continuing work at home
- [x] Created QUICK_REF.md for fast reference

### Build Infrastructure  
- [x] Created `manual-build.yml` GitHub Actions workflow for cross-platform builds
- [x] Created `build_local.sh` script for local macOS builds
- [x] Verified build spec file `build_files/ResearchBuddy5.1.1.spec` is ready
- [x] All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

### Repository Organization
- [x] Confirmed repository name `research-buddy` is correct and consistent
- [x] Verified folder structure is clean and organized
- [x] All workflows are in `.github/workflows/`

## ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS / TODO

### Executables (PRIORITY!)
- [ ] **macOS executable** - Build was interrupted, needs restart
- [ ] **Windows executable** - Requires GitHub Actions or Windows machine
- [ ] **Linux executable** - Can build on your Linux machine at home

### Workflow
1. **Easiest:** Trigger GitHub Actions "Manual Build All Platforms" workflow
   - Builds all 3 platforms automatically in ~10-15 minutes
   - Download artifacts and upload to release

2. **Alternative:** Build Linux locally on your home machine
   - See NEXT_STEPS_LINUX.md for complete instructions
   - Use build_local.sh or manual PyInstaller commands

### Release Creation
- [ ] Create v5.1.1 release on GitHub
- [ ] Upload 3 executables (.app, .exe, .tar.gz or .AppImage)
- [ ] Verify download links in README work correctly
- [ ] Test executables on each platform if possible

## üö® IMMEDIATE GA SOLUTION

While executables are being built, GAs can use **GitHub Codespaces**:

1. Go to https://github.com/OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy
2. Click green "Code" ‚Üí "Codespaces" ‚Üí "Create codespace"
3. Run: `python run_research_buddy.py`

**This works NOW on any computer with a browser!**

## üìä Current State

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ Source code runs perfectly with Python
- ‚úÖ GitHub Codespaces works for GAs
- ‚úÖ README clearly shows download links (once executables exist)
- ‚úÖ Build workflows are ready to trigger

### What's Needed:
- ‚è≥ Actually build the 3 executables
- ‚è≥ Upload them to a GitHub release
- ‚è≥ Test that download links work

## üéØ YOUR GOAL

Get GAs downloading and running executables without any Python/git/terminal setup.

**Priority:** Build the 3 executables and create the release.

**Timeline:** 
- GitHub Actions build: ~15 minutes
- Local Linux build: ~5-10 minutes  
- Release creation: ~5 minutes
- **Total: ~30 minutes of work**
