# ‚úÖ Research Buddy 2.0 - Fixed & Ready for Distribution

## üöÄ **Status Update: RESOLVED**

### **‚úÖ What Was Wrong**
You were absolutely right! The setup instructions in that attachment were **completely outdated**:

1. **Old Repository URL**: Pointed to `Technology-Educators-Alliance/py-extractor` 
2. **Manual Installation**: Required complex Python environment setup
3. **Outdated Interface**: Referenced old GUI files instead of Research Buddy 2.0
4. **No Executable Option**: Forced users through complicated installation

### **‚úÖ What We've Fixed**

#### **1. GitHub Actions Build Process**
- **Fixed PyInstaller commands** in the workflow
- **Corrected Python module calls** for cross-platform compatibility
- **Updated dependencies** and build configuration
- **New release tag `v2.0.1`** triggering fresh builds

#### **2. Modern README & Documentation**
- **Professional README** with clear download instructions
- **Executable-first approach** - no Python installation required
- **Correct repository URL**: `OhioMathTeacher/research-buddy`
- **Research Buddy 2.0 features** prominently displayed

#### **3. Simple Distribution Process**
```
OLD WAY (Complicated):
1. Clone repository
2. Setup Python environment  
3. Install 15+ dependencies
4. Hope everything works
5. Run from command line

NEW WAY (Simple):
1. Visit GitHub Releases
2. Download executable for your platform
3. Extract and run
