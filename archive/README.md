# Archive Folder Organization

This archive folder contains legacy files, documentation, and development tools that are not part of the main Research Buddy 4.0 application but are preserved for reference and historical purposes.

## Folder Structure

### `/legacy-gui/`
Legacy GUI implementations and experimental interfaces from earlier versions of Research Buddy. These files represent the evolution of the user interface before the modern launcher was implemented.

### `/analysis-tools/`
Development and analysis utilities used during Research Buddy development, including pattern analysis scripts, false negative detection tools, and environment setup utilities.

### `/documentation/`
Historical documentation, guides, release notes, and analysis reports from various phases of Research Buddy development. Includes training guides, configuration documentation, and project planning materials.

### `/test-files/`
Test scripts, evidence files, and validation tools used during development and testing phases.

### `/old-versions/`
Previous versions of README files and other core documentation for historical reference.

## Purpose

This organization keeps the main Research Buddy directory clean and professional while preserving the development history and tools that contributed to the project's evolution.

Research Buddy 4.0 represents a significant milestone in the project's development, with the introduction of the modern GUI launcher, secure credential management, and professional user experience.
